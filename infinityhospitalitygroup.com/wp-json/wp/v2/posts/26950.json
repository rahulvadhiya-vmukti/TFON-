After really digging into what was actually important to us, we sat at our dining room table together and discussed what a summertime micro wedding might look like. We knew our families would be sad that they weren\u2019t there, but we decided that getting married just the two of us would be the best decision for us.<\/p>\n<p>After thinking through what our ideal ceremony would be, we decided to get married in the Smoky Mountains a few weeks later. So on June 21, we drove to a beautiful and remote part of the Foothills Parkway in the pouring rain to meet our photographer and our officiant.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, it stopped raining just long enough for us to exchange the vows we\u2019d written the night before and take a few photos.<\/p>\n<p>Then we kept the secret for almost a month and a half before telling our immediate family. We were worried they would be upset with us, but they were overjoyed and so proud of us for getting married on our own terms and making the very best of an unprecedented situation. That same weekend with the support of our families, we made the decision to postpone our celebration and finalized a new date in September of 2021.<\/p>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"fw-divider-space space-sm  clearfix\"  ><\/div>\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"fw-row\">\n\t<div id=\"column-66616cc832bdd\" class=\"fw-col-sm-12 tf-sh-e18425ab70dc2517d86b58893b485faf\" >\n\t<div class=\"fw-wrap-col-inner clearfix  \"   >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"fw-col-inner\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class=\"fw-block-image-parent  \"  style=\"width: 100%; \">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"fw-block-image-child fw-ratio-3-2 fw-ratio-container\">\n\t\t\t\t<noscript itemscope itemtype=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/ImageObject\" itemprop=\"image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/infinityhospitalitygroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Cori-Elopement_3.jpg\"  alt=\"Cori and Tony Eloping\" data-maxdpr=\"1.7\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https:\/\/infinityhospitalitygroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Cori-Elopement_3.jpg\"><meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"1200\"><meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"800\"><\/noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/infinityhospitalitygroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Cori-Elopement_3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/infinityhospitalitygroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Cori-Elopement_3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/infinityhospitalitygroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Cori-Elopement_3-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/infinityhospitalitygroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Cori-Elopement_3-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/infinityhospitalitygroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Cori-Elopement_3-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/infinityhospitalitygroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Cori-Elopement_3.jpg 1200w\"   alt=\"Cori and Tony Eloping\" data-maxdpr=\"1.7\" class=\"lazyload\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n<div class=\"fw-divider-space space-sm  clearfix\"  ><\/div>\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"fw-row\">\n\t<div id=\"column-66616cc83440a\" class=\"fw-col-sm-12 tf-sh-78f85d06211a660911cc035e7add1998\" >\n\t<div class=\"fw-wrap-col-inner clearfix  \"   >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"fw-col-inner\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"fw-text-box tf-sh-5c6a7f053a486ffdc429b7ac786ddabf \" >\n\t<div class=\"fw-text-inner\">\n\t\t<h6><strong>How have you been feeling throughout this process?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>Our emotions have really been all over the place. When lockdown began, we took a step back and paused all wedding planning because everything seemed so far away, and making plans for something that might not happen felt sad. Once we scheduled our elopement date, it felt wonderful to have something to look forward to again and the October wedding held a little less weight for us.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, we couldn\u2019t (and still can\u2019t!) wait to celebrate with our friends and family, but we felt at peace with potentially having to move our wedding date.

But forgetting about what everyone would eat or where they would sit or what our entrance song would be for a short time, and just taking the time to just focus on the two of us, was really meaningful.<\/p>\n<p>I feel like it has been helpful not to concentrate on what we may feel was taken away from us, but on what we were given.

It has been important for me to remember that although I was preparing myself to make this decision for months, it was still deeply sad to sign our postponement paperwork and let go of our October wedding date. We\u2019d been dreaming of that date for over a year and dreaming of the celebration for years before then, which rings true for so many people celebrating any number of milestones this year.<\/p>\n<p>We all look forward to the joy we\u2019ll feel and the memories we\u2019ll make for ourselves and for our loved ones.\u00a0 Not only is a wedding a large financial investment, but an enormous emotional investment as well. And when the fate of that joy and those memories are in question, it can deeply affect us all, especially considering our daily safety is in question too. Having empathy for your fellow man and caring about their wellbeing is what will help get all of us through this pandemic.<\/p>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"fw-divider-space space-sm  clearfix\"  ><\/div>\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"fw-row\">\n\t<div id=\"column-66616cc8376d5\" class=\"fw-col-sm-12 tf-sh-156a413e7be29cafa368be016495caa6\" >\n\t<div class=\"fw-wrap-col-inner clearfix  \"   >\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"fw-col-inner\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"fw-text-box tf-sh-7da13abcc2bf0f30177d03e513a59b54 \" >\n\t<div class=\"fw-text-inner\">\n\t\t<h6><strong>What would your advice be to couples who are considering cancelling or postponing their wedding?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>I would encourage everyone to have an open and truly honest discussion with their partner about what is important to them before inviting other voices into the conversation. What helped us figure out what was best for us was fully expressing our fears, admittedly rational and sometimes irrational. For example, \"will no one come to the wedding if we\u2019re already married?\" They will still come! And also what we were really looking forward to about our wedding.<\/p>\n<p>When we looked at all of our options, having a meaningful ceremony for just the two of us and throwing a \u201cparty worth waiting for\u201d next year was the very best choice.\u00a0Yes, we have another year to wait for our wedding, but our vendors have been secured and everything is mostly planned.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, the outpouring of love and support that we\u2019ve received has really helped us get through the pandemic.
